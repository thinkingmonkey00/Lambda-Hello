Hello! My name is Melissa and I hail from the SF Bay Area.

Three words that describe me might be 'goofy', 'observant', and 'friendly' :)

Coding, for me, is the perfect blend of art and math. I love it!

My main hobby is performing in theatrical productions. I recently completed a run of a reimagined Romeo + Juliet and I sit on the Board of Directors for SJS Theatrical Productions.
